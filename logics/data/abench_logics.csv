Every day, two buses will depart simultaneously at 7:00 AM and 4:00 PM for each direct route between two schools .The program requires ​​direct one-way trips between any two schools​​ without intermediate stops.Each ​​direct route​​ has ​​2 buses per day​​ departing at:7:00 AM​​-4:00 PM one bus from Nanjing No.1 to Suzhou International and another from Suzhou International to Nanjing No.1 at the same time).
How many different types of bus tickets need to be printed to implement this program?
