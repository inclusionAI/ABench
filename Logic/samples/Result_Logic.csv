3,B C,"In the mystical land of Eldoria, three wizards—Elara, Thorn, and Zara—each specialize in one of three magical disciplines: Chronomancer always tells the truth, Shadowweaver always lies, or Dreamweaver alternates between truth and lies. During a council, they make the following declarations:
Elara: 
(1)Thorn is a Chronomancer.
(2) I am a Dreamweaver.
Thorn: 
(1) Elara is a Shadowweaver.
(2) I am a Chronomancer.
Zara: 
(1) I am a Chronomancer.
(2) Thorn is a Dreamweaver.
Based on their statements, which of the following can be true?
A、The statements of Thorn about himself is true
B、The statements of Zara about himself is true
C、If Elara is Shadowweaver, then the statements of Elara about himself is false
D、If the statements of Thorn about himself is false, then Thorn is Shadowweaver
E、Elara is a Chronomancer
F、Zara is a Dreamweaver",MCQ,NO,"

To determine which statements can be true, we analyze the possible roles of Elara, Thorn, and Zara based on their statements and the constraints of their disciplines (Chronomancer always tells the truth, Shadowweaver always lies, Dreamweaver alternates between truth and lies).

1. **Elara's Role Analysis**:
   - If Elara were a Chronomancer (truth-teller), her statements would contradict (she would simultaneously be a Chronomancer and Dreamweaver). Thus, Elara cannot be a Chronomancer.
   - If Elara is a Shadowweaver (liar), both her statements are false: Thorn is not a Chronomancer, and she is not a Dreamweaver. This leads to Thorn being a Dreamweaver and Zara a Chronomancer.

2. **Thorn's Role Analysis**:
   - Thorn, being a Dreamweaver (alternates truth and lies), starts with a true statement (""Elara is a Shadowweaver"") and follows with a false statement (""I am a Chronomancer"").

3. **Zara's Role Analysis**:
   - Zara, being a Chronomancer (truth-teller), both her statements are true: ""I am a Chronomancer"" and ""Thorn is a Dreamweaver"".

**Option Analysis**:
- **B**: Zara's statements about himself are true (Zara is a Chronomancer, both statements true). Valid in the valid scenario.
- **C**: If Elara is a Shadowweaver, her statements about herself (false). This is a tautology as Shadowweavers always lie. Hence, always true.
- Other options (A, D, E, F) are invalid based on contradictions or impossibilities derived from role constraints.
