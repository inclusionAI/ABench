## ðŸŒŸ Overview

**ABench** is an evolving open-source benchmark suite designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) on **complex cross-domain tasks**. By targeting current model weaknesses, ABench provides systematic challenges in **high-difficulty specialized domains**, including physics, actuarial science, logical reasoning, law, and psychology.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Objectives
1.  **Address Evaluation Gaps**: Design high-differentiation assessment tasks targeting **underperforming question types**
2.  **Establish Unified Standards**: Create **reliable, comparable benchmarks** for multi-domain LLM evaluation
3.  **Expand Capability Boundaries**: Drive continuous optimization of knowledge systems and reasoning mechanisms through challenging innovative problems
